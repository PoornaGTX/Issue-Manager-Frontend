# Project overview

The developed project management tool that enables user account creation and login for efficient project management. Upon registration, users can select their company from pre-defined options, ensuring seamless collaboration within their organizational context. The tool supports multiple user roles, including project managers, testers, and developers. Project managers are granted advanced permissions to assign tasks to team members and manage their activities, fostering streamlined collaboration and enhancing project efficiency. They also have the authority to delete or edit tasks assigned to others within the company. Additionally, I integrated a feature to monitor task statuses using graphical charts, providing project managers with clear visual insights into project progress and team performance, thereby facilitating informed decision-making and successful project outcomes.

Additionally, the tool features filters for categorizing tasks into "Personal" and "Assigned to Me" categories. The "Personal" category includes tasks created by the user, while the "Assigned to Me" category lists tasks specifically assigned to them by the project manager, facilitating focused task management.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
